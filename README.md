# About Dynamic-Array
An array abstraction that grows and shrinks dynamically and can store elements of any type
This exercise is from Rice University's COMP 321 Lab 1 assignment, Dynamic Arrays. The dynamic array abstraction is allocated on the heap in contiguous memory, doubles in size when full, halves in size when 1/4 full, and is deallocated when freed.
